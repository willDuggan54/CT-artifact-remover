Code from my 2021 Summer REU Project "Deep Learning for Sparse-View Filtered Backprojection Imaging".

Filtered Backprojection (FBP) algorithms are computationally efficient and therefore, widely used. These algorithms however, require a lot of data to correctly compute an image through an inverse function. In the case of Computed Tomography (CT) scans, collecting a lot of data means taking lots of X-ray samples. These X-rays can be both expensive and have health effects on the patient. Sparse-view scans are undersampled, meaning they collect less data. This approach however, has the potential to introduce artifacts into the image. This project focuses on using Deep Learning techniques to remove these artifacts from the sparse-view filtered backprojection CT images.
